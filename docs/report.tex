\author{James Campbell}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Beacons have exploded onto the scene recently with increased hardware support and widespread platform adoption. Multiple vendors and form factors are emerging opening up new creative opportunities. At such an early stage in the life-cycle of the technology the focus is typically on entirely tailor-made platforms. How the enterprise is to effectively manage and monitor widespread roll outs is often not the top priority. Here we describe a platform to tackle such problems in a reliable manner culminating in a proof of concept set of applications.
